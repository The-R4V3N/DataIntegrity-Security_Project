## Features

- This project showcast a secure communication between a client and a server. The client is a desktop application written in Python 3.10.12 and the server is a ESP32 microcontroller written in C++.
- The communication is secured using the following protocols:
  - HMAC-SHA256
  - AES-256
  - RSA-2048

- The client can send requests to the server and the server will respond to the client's requests.
- The Following requests are implemented:
  - Core Temperature reading
  - LED control

- The server can handle only one client session at a time.
- Sessions will expire after 1 minute of inactivity.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3** with the following librarys: Tkinter, pyserial, python-mbedtls
- **PlatformIO** (for building and uploading firmware to the ESP32)
- **ESP32** Used in this Project is a Olimax ESP32 Development Board

### Building

- **Build the Server:**
Execute `platformio run` in the server directory to compile the project.

### Execute

-**Using Makefile:**
This project has a Makefile that can be used to build and run the project.
To build and run the server execute `make server` in the root of the project.
To run the client execute `make client` in the root of the project.
Additionally, you can run `make clean` to remove all compiled files and cache files.
You also have the option to use `make .PHONY` to run all the above commands in sequence. Starting with the server, then the client.

-**Run the Server:**
Execute `platformio run --target upload` to upload the compiled code to the Olimax ESP32-EVB board.

-**Run the Client:**
Execute `python3 -m client.src.client` in the root directory of the project to start the client application.

### Desktop Client and Server

- The Desktop Client  is a Python application with a basic GUI made with Tkinter.
- The servier is a ESP32 microcontroller that communicates with the client over serial communication.

### Dependencies

- **PlatformIO:** An ecosystem for IoT development.
- **C++ Standard Libraries:** For core functionalities.
- **ESP32-EVB Board Support:** Specific libraries and drivers for the Olimax ESP32-EVB board.
- **Python 3.10.12:** The core programming language used.
- **Tkinter:** A Python library for creating the graphical user interface.
- **Pyserial:** Essential for handling serial communication.
- **python-mbedtls:** Provides security features like encryption.
